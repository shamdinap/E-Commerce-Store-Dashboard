### 💡 Key Insights and Recommendations

The analysis highlights critical areas for strategic focus:

#### 1. Repeat Visitor Value & Retention
* [cite_start]**Repeat Visitors** generate **19% more revenue per session** (\$4.74) than **New Visitors** (\$3.97)[cite: 46, 49, 57].

#### 2. Marketing Campaign Performance (CVR)
* [cite_start]**Highest Efficiency:** Brand campaigns (e.g., `bsearch - brand` with 0.089 CVR and `gsearch - brand` with 0.075 CVR) are the most successful in terms of traffic quality[cite: 24, 25, 30, 31].
* [cite_start]**Optimization Opportunity:** Non-Brand campaigns, specifically `gsearch - nonbrand` (0.067 CVR) and `socialbook - desktop` (0.052 CVR), represent the biggest lever for overall business growth, as they often attract new customers[cite: 29, 28, 32, 33].

#### 3. Top Seller & Refund Risk
* [cite_start]**Top Seller:** "The Original Mr. Fuzzy" is the highest revenue generator (\$1.21M) [cite: 124] [cite_start]and also the top seller by items sold[cite: 119].
